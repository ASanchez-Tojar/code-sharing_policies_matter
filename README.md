Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar, Aya Bezine, Marija Purgar, Antica Culina. *In Preparation*. **Code-sharing policies are associated with increased reproducibility potential of ecological findings**.

---

The repository consists of an Rproject ([analyses.Rproj](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/analyses.Rproj)) with 3 scripts and 3 folders containing the data either needed to run these scripts or created by these scripts, including the figures. For a detailed description of all the files and how to run the repository, please see below. For any further information about this repository, please contact: [Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=Sh-Rjq8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), email: alfredo.tojar@gmail.com. 


## Information about scripts, folders and files within:

Folders:
-	[code](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/code): contains all three scripts used to process, clean, standardize data, and generate figures for the project.
 - - [001_data_cleaning_and_standardization_without_policies.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/001_data_cleaning_and_standardization_without_policies.R): used to clean and standardize the dataset for studies without explicit code-sharing policies. This script imports raw data, processes inconsistencies, and prepares the data for analysis.
 - - [002_data_cleaning_and_standardization_with_policies.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/002_data_cleaning_and_standardization_with_policies.R): used to clean and standardize the dataset for studies with explicit code-sharing policies. Similar to the first script but tailored to datasets that incorporate policy information.
 - - [003_plotting.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/003_plotting.R): used to import the final cleaned databases (from the first two scripts) and generate the figures included in the main text. 

- [data](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data): contains all [raw](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data/raw_databases) and [clean](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data/clean_databases) data files necessary for our three [scripts](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/code).
- [figures](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/figures): contains all figures generated by [003_plotting.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/003_plotting.R) and included in the main text.
