The repository consists of an Rproject with 3 scripts and 3 folders containing the data either needed to run these scripts or created by these scripts, including the figures. For a detailed description of all the files, please see below. To run this repository, first download and unzipped the entire repository and open the Rproject file: [analyses.Rproj](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/analyses.Rproj). The scripts are named in the order that they should be run, from 001 to 003.

## Information about folders and files within:

Folders:
-	[code](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/code): contains all three scripts used to process, clean, standardize data, and generate figures for the project.
 - - [001_data_cleaning_and_standardization_without_policies.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/001_data_cleaning_and_standardization_without_policies.R): used to clean and standardize the dataset for studies without a code-sharing policys. This script imports raw data, processes inconsistencies, and prepares the data for analysis.
 - - [002_data_cleaning_and_standardization_with_policies.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/002_data_cleaning_and_standardization_with_policies.R): used to clean and standardize the dataset for studies with a code-sharing policy. Similar to the first script (i.e., "001_") but tailored to datasets that incorporate policy information.
 - - [003_plotting.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/003_plotting.R): used to import the final cleaned databases (generated by the first two scripts) and generate the figures included in the main text. 

- [data](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data): contains all [raw](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data/raw_databases) and [clean](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data/clean_databases) data files necessary for or generated by our three [scripts](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/code).
- [figures](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/figures): contains all figures generated by [003_plotting.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/blob/main/code/003_plotting.R) and included in the main text of this study.

## Codebooks and metadata:
We provide a codebook and a metadata file for each of the two clean databases corresponding to journals with and without a code-sharing policy, separately. These files are in the folder [codebooks_and_metadata](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/code-sharing_policies_matter/tree/main/data/clean_databases/codebooks_and_metadata). The codebooks were generated using the Web application of the codebook R package, available at: https://codebook.formr.org/. The metadata files were obtained, adjusted, and completed from the codebooks, and saved as separate .csv files.
